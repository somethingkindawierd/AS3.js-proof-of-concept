Project Description
===================

Inception
---------

This project started as a curiosity of Jon Beebe, wondering if it'd be possible to port ActionScript 3 classes to JavaScript so that AS3 code could run natively in Javascript.

Proof-of-concept
----------------

To consider the proof-of-concept successful, I must be able to run ActionScript3 code, with minimal alterations, in an HTML5 page. I must be able to:

*   Create Sprites in a canvas element
*   Perform basic drawing in the sprites, such as creating a circle and filling it with a color and stroke.
*   Process basic events, such as mouse and keyboard events

Testing
=======

The barrier to entry for contributors needs to be low. As such it will not be necessary to own the Flash or Flex IDE to code or run the AS3 samples.
